# Grapejuice Install Scripts
Install scripts for the Grapejuice Linux Roblox runner, for different Linux distros, instead of pasting commands in, you just need to run the script for your distro!

1 (flatpak). Install wine first, Install flatpak, run "flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo" Then reboot, afterward run the script.
